# o3-mini prompt to extract eligibility criteria into a 2 column table
prompt: | 

    The following text was extracted from a clinical trial protocol.   The text
    might have a table of contents.   If the file has a table of contents, skip over
    it to the body text.

    The body text of the file has a section called something like Eligibility and 2
    sets of eligibility questions:  inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria.
    Possibly called inclusion and exclusion without the word criteria.
    
    I need you to extract the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria into a
    CSV‐formatted text with two columns. 
    
    There should be 2 columns - with 1 row for each Inclusion/Exclusion criterion - 
    since there will be different numbers of criteria - 
    its expected that the Inclusion column will have different number of rows than the Exclusion column
    
    Inclusion criteria are the predefined characteristics or conditions that
    individuals must meet to be eligible to participate in a clinical study or
    trial. They are used to identify the target population and ensure that enrolled
    participants have the specific attributes needed to address the study’s
    objectives. These criteria can include factors such as age, sex, diagnosis,
    disease stage, laboratory values, performance status, and prior treatment
    history, among others. Essentially, inclusion criteria help ensure that the
    study results will be applicable to the intended patient population and that
    participants are likely to benefit from—or safely tolerate—the intervention
    being tested.
    
    Exclusion criteria are a set of predefined conditions, characteristics, or
    factors that disqualify individuals from participating in a clinical study. They
    are used to ensure participant safety, maintain the integrity of the study data,
    and minimize potential confounding variables that might affect the study’s
    outcomes. Exclusion criteria often include medical conditions, concurrent
    treatments, or other factors that could interfere with the evaluation of the
    study intervention or pose additional risks to the participant.
